    <p>Hello, I am from a city called Benin in a state called Edo, in Nigeria. It's a cool serene place with 
        with a lot of rich history and culture. 
    </p>
    <p>I am a Filmmaker, I make movies, tell and write stories for a living.
         It's my passion and it gives me so joy doing it. 
         I am also passionate about computers and how you can program it 
        to do many things that are beneficial to us and the world we live in.
    </p>
    <p>I am so grateful for the opportunity to obtain an education through BYU-Idaho.
        I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ for 14 years now, it is one of the greatest 
        decisions i have ever made.
        I love this quote by president Thomas S. Monson 'choose your love and love your choice.'
